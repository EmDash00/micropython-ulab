While it is relatively easy to write a PID controller in `python`, the problem with that approach is execution speed: even in thermal applications, where the time scales are not particularly short, running more than one controller simultanously might be difficult, but if the goal is e.g. to mechanically control a self-balancing robot, the task will prove outright impossible. The reason for this slowness of the code execution is the number of floating point operations, where the type-agnostic nature of `python` requires constant type conversion.\n",

Likewise, data can be output directly to the physical device (in most cases a digital-to-analogue converter), if it can take data from a buffer. This direct access to the device data eliminates the need for data conversion in `python`, and reduces the number of objects that must be passed to the controller loop. In fact, in most cases the controller can be run without moving any data whatsoever, simply by calling a method of the `PID` instance without arguments."

In the simplest case, a thermistor will form half of a voltage divider connected to a reference voltage $U_{ref}$, and the potential $U_{meas}$ is measured at mid-point. It is obvious that even if the thermistors temperature-resistance relationship $R_{th}(T)$ were to be linear, the measured potential will not be (if the thermistor is in the lower half of the divider, $R$ and $R_{th}$ will have to be swapped in the expression below, but that does not alter the fact that $U_{meas}$ is non-linear in $R_{th}$):\n",

In the most general case, finding the Taylor series expansion of the inverse function is highly non-trivial. Ben Coleman gives a very good exposition of the [subject](https://randorithms.com/2021/08/31/Taylor-Series-Inverse.html). But it might not be required to go down that path: given a small number of values of the $T(U_{meas})$ relationship, we might get away with a polynomial fit, and use that in lieu of the Taylor series. This must be done in terms of $(U_{meas} - U_0)$, however."
